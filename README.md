# scala-practice
my first scala project

I made this repo to practice scala. I found this useful [link](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html) for
setting up a scala project using **sbt**.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following...

* scala
* sbt
* IDE

## Project setup

First clone this repository, and then `cd` into the project directory `scala-practice`.
```
cd scala-practice
```
